<h1>Rickrolling</h1><br/>
<p>Rickrolling is a common prank (A.K.A troll) done on the internet that involves a user being tricked on clicking a link to the now-famous video of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up.</a> This became massivly memed upon and is still used today! Rickrolling has even been named "The meme that will never die" becasue of it's sustained popularity.</p><br/>
<h3>Origin</h3><br/>
<p>The meme originated in 2006 when a person created "duckroll", a meme in which they had replaced eggrolls with the word 'duck'. Shortly after this a user replied, posting a picture of a duck on wheels.</p><br/>

<br/>
<p>By 2007 the meme had become popular for the same reasons as the current meme but never became widespread. But, when the trailer for GTA IV released, it crashed the video because of it reaching YouTube's limits. People were looking for reuploads just to see the thing. That's when a man by the name of Shawn Cotter tricked people to land on a young Rick Astley dancing on their screen.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Current Day</h3>
<br/>
<p>Now, in 2024, Rickrolling has become a global trend. With the total views on YouTube being 1.5 <strong>Billion,</strong> and still going. With the meme now used in countless places across the internet, it's safe to say that it's not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
