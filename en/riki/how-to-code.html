<h1>How to become a programmer</h1>
<h2>Yadda yadda yadda, <strong>**Not endorsing or promoting anything and not affiliated with any thing mentioned in this article**</strong> yadda yadda yadda</h2>
<h6>above came from the metro commercials</h6>
<p><em>There are many ways to become a programer, but stick to what you want</em> <br><br>
Programming is kind of like a foreign language to tell computers what to do. There are many ways to learn programing, but it reallly depends on what your goals are. If you wanted to learn how to make a website, then <code>html</code> is a good starting place. Or if you are trying to build applications, you will need <code>javascript</code> and variations of <code>C</code>. You get it. If your goals are anywhere between those needs, then this article is for you! (If I missed anything, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:rk@riki-pedia.org">rk@riki-pedia.org</a>.)<br/>
</p>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><code>HTML</code> <em>(HyperText Markup Language)</em>is the main language the web is built on. It is used to tell the browser what to do, what languages to parse, and where to direct the user in the event of an error. I learned <code>html</code> from many places, including <a href ="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/">Khan Academy</a>, a completly free and online platform that helps learn and improve on all sorts of things. There are also many other options like <a href = "https://codecademy.com">Codecademy,</a> or <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. All are good desicions, but it reallly depends on what you are doing.</p>
<br>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<br>
<p>CSS,(or Cascading Style Sheet), is used to modify <code>html</code> by adding stylish items to it. It adds <div class = "cool">cool fonts</div>, fancy backgrounds, and more. A lot of times this comes with learning HTML, but this can be learned seperatly. The sites above should also teach <code>css</code>.</p>
<br/>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (JS) is used for many things. It is used to make webpages interactive by modifying HTML. This is sometimes taught alongside HTML, other times you learn JS seperately. Places like those above could teach JS, or you can use other sources from across the web. Sources online say that good places to learn JS are the ones above, <a href = "https://codecombat.com/">CodeCombat</a>, <a href = "https://coursera.org">Coursera</a>,and <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-essentials"/>Udemy</a>.</p>
<br/>
<h2>C</h2>
<p>C is a very old yet powerful coding language. While it has had a few powerful variations, such as C++ or C#, C is still widly used today, 40+ years later! While I could write a paragraph talking about how brilliant it is, I will instead tell you how and where to learn it. First you could use <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php">W3Schools </a>(mentioned again I know), which is where I am currently learning C. There is also <a href = "https://learn-c.org">Learn-C.org</a>, a website dedicated to teaching C.</p>
<br/>
<h3>While all these are very useful coding languages, stick to what you like.</h3>

<p>All sites listed here were found straight off of <a href = "https://google.com">Google</a>.</p>
