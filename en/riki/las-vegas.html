<h1>Las Vegas</h1>
<p>Las Vegas is a large city in Nevada. It is commonly known for many things, including The Strip, MGM, Casinos, and the Hoover Dam. On July 1, 2023, I went to Vegas, where I saw many things. I wrote about them in <a href = "https://blog.riki-pedia.org/">my blog</a>. These things include New York-New York, Paris, Circus Circus, and <strong>many</strong> more.</p>
<h2>Casinos</h2>
<p>Casinos are very common in Vegas. They are places where people go to gamble their money and hope to win a lot more than they lost. In Vegas, casinos are located in or near <em>The Strip</em>. Usually, casinos have kid-friendly areas, such as arcades. You will find that a majority of casinos in Vegas are owned by <em>MGM</em>. For instance, during my stay in Vegas, we went to a dinner show at a casino/hotel called <em>Excallibur</em>. The show went with the theme, it was called <em>Tournament of Kings</em>.</p>
<h2>MGM</h2>
<p>In Vegas, MGM owns a lot of the hotel/casino buildings. MGM is a film company that made shows <em>Tom & Jerry, Pink Panther</em>, and many more. Owning many properties and TV franchises may be one thing, but owning <em> luxury </em> hotels is another. When I was in Vegas, I stayed at <em>The Signature at MGM Grand</em>, where they had luxury <strong>everything</strong>. They had valet, (time-consuming) bell service and much more. They would do anything for you (so long as you tip them).</p>
