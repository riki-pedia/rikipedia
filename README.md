Rikipedia is a website designed (ish) to be wikipedia but not and be funny. Semi-to mock, and kind of a blog. 
## Editing
To edit you can:
1. Edit an article through the menu button.
 - OR
2. Author a new article by submitting a PR.

I know most GitHub users know how to submit a PR, but some people might be new here.
To add a change, you have to fork the repo and make a change. Then, you can contribute and fill out the PR form.
